# Collaborative Git Workflow Practice

This repository is used by team members to **practice and simulate real-world Git collaboration workflows**.

The goal of this project is not to build a specific application, but to improve team skills in:
- Version control
- Collaboration
- Code review
- Conflict resolution

---

## Objectives

- Practice Git branching strategies
- Work with Pull Requests
- Review teammates' code
- Resolve merge conflicts
- Maintain clean commit history
- Follow a collaborative development process

---

## What We Practice

- Creating and managing branches
- Making meaningful commits
- Opening and reviewing Pull Requests
- Handling merge conflicts
- Collaborating in a multi-developer environment
- Following Git best practices

---

## Workflow

1. Create a new branch from `main`
2. Make changes and commit with clear messages
3. Push the branch to remote
4. Open a Pull Request
5. Review and approve changes
6. Merge into `main`

---

## Rules

- Do not commit directly to `main`
- Use clear and descriptive commit messages
- Keep Pull Requests small and focused
- Respect code reviews and feedback

---

## Team Collaboration

This repository is a **team-based practice environment**, designed to reflect how software development teams collaborate in real projects.
